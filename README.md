This is my solution to the Jotto Problem.

I found out about this via [this](https://youtu.be/c33AZBnRHks?si=_DtsjOe_0Xz12iZy) YouTube video.

My Code runs, with 20 threads, in about 2.7 seconds, which is slow compared to the ones mentioned in the video but still faster than a month or my old versions
